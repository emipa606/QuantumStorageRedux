  <ResearchProject_QSRWarehouse.description>Allows construction of quantum warehouses: devices that are placed underneath stockpile zones to form global quantum network of the all quantum warehouses, on top of acting like quantum stockpiles themselves.

When powered, a zone's warehouse makes sure that all warehouses in the global quantum network are evenly filled and tries to minimize the amount of incomplete item stacks.</ResearchProject_QSRWarehouse.description>
