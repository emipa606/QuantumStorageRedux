  <ResearchProject_QSRStockpile.description>Allows construction of quantum stockpiles: devices that are placed underneath stockpile zones in order to store more than one item or stack of items in a given space.

Each stockpile connected to it's own local quantum network.

When powered, these stockpiles scan zone spaces adjacent to them and, if the zone's filter allows it, pull any items onto themselves.

Items are steadily superposed, so each one remains fully accessible, and nothing catastrophic will happen even if the power supply fails.</ResearchProject_QSRStockpile.description>
